# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is a two-player game that allows players to alternate turns and determine a winner or a draw based on standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Players take turns as either "O" or "X" to fill in the 3x3 grid.
- **Winner Detection**: The game automatically detects a win when a player fills three consecutive cells in a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Draw Detection**: The game identifies a draw when all cells are filled without a winner.
- **Game Reset**: Players can reset the game at any time using the "Reset Game" button or start a new game after a match.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is styled to be visually appealing and accessible on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game board and control elements.
- **CSS**: Styling for the board layout, buttons, and winning messages.
- **JavaScript**: Core game logic for turn handling, winner detection, and game reset functionality.
